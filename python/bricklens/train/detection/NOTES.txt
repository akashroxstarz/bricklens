Current status:

- Model loading and instantiation should work

To do:

- Migrate over to Ignite and WandB for training loop, checkpoints, etc.
- Generate dataset in the simple format.
- Look at how training code encodes information on classes. Current code seems to cap number
  of classes to 3.
- Look at assumption of 416 x 416 images.
- Consider starting from existing Yolo2 pretrained weights rather than training from scratch?
- Look at anchor boxes - they are almost certainly not right.
